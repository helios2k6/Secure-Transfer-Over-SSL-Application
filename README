Secure Transfer Over SSL Application (STA)

1. Introduction
The Secure Transfer Over SSL Application is a direct friend-to-friend application that allows you to connect to a specific peer over SSL and share files. This is not a swarm-based or public file-sharing application. 

This application is meant to securely and reliably transfer files from one peer to another. 

STA supports bandwidth throttling and resuming broken downloads. 

STA requires that both peers have public certificates that have been signed by a commonly trusted CA before any connection is made. 

STA uses UPnP Port-mapping to enable port forwarding when behind network routers.

STA is set up to act as both the server and the client, and thus requires two SSL connections before any action can be taken. Peer A must connect to Peer B's server socket and Peer B must connect to Peer A's server socket before any communication can take place.

Only one file can be downloaded at a time, but simultaneous uploading and downloading is possible.
